<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-adidas"><a href="https://www.adidas-group.com/en/about/profile/">About Adidas</a></h2>
<p>Headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany, Adidas is a multinational corporation known as one of the most popular sports brands in the world that designs, develops, produces, and markets a wide range of sports clothing, footwear, and accessories. The brand was founded in 1924 by Adi Dassler and his brother Rudolf, hence the original name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (“Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory”). However, in 1947, the two brothers split after their relationship went south, leading to Rudolf leaving and creating Puma, which later became one of Adidas’s competitors. In 1949, the brand was registered as ‘Adi Dassler adidas Sportschuhfabrik’ by Adi Dassler, marking the born of Adidas.</p>

<p>Adidas emphasizes that its core values are rooted in sports – that is, <em>‘through sports we have the power to change lives.’</em> This is also incorporated into the brand’s mission – <em>‘to be the best sports brand in the world’</em> and the stated attitude – <em>‘impossible is nothing.’</em></p>

<section id="strategically-creative" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategically-creative">Strategically Creative</h2>
<p>Adidas’ marketing strategy is to position the brand as the most innovative and stylish in the sports industry. The company has adopted a multi-channel approach to digital branding that includes social media, influencer marketing, email marketing, and e-commerce. Adidas’ digital marketing campaigns are known for their creativity and engaging content that resonates with its target audience. This approach has helped the brand to increase its visibility, brand recognition, and customer loyalty in the competitive sports industry.</p>

<h1>Email Marketing</h1>
<section id="too-often-too-many-emails" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="too-often-too-many-emails">Too often, too many emails</h2>
<p>Since July 26, 2022, when I first purchased a pair of Adidas shoes and registered an account on their website, they have sent me 139 emails, mostly one email at a time, but sometimes 2-3 emails on the same day when a special holiday/event is around the corner (days with more emails have darker color in the chart below), summing up to about 4-5 emails per week on average. From a customer’s point of view, this is way too often for email marketing. I believe the optimal frequency should only be about 2-3 emails per week at maximum to encourage purchases with discounts but not cheapen the brand.</p>
<p><img src="L.Tran_HW4_files/image/calendar.png" class="img-fluid"> Compared to the brand’s general sending behavior and promotion data from <a href="https://www.mailcharts.com/">MailCharts</a> it seems they are doing just the right amount on average.</p>

<section id="cta-with-little-personalization" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cta-with-little-personalization">CTA, with little personalization</h2>
<p>Almost if not all of the emails I received from Adidas are CTAs (Call to Action – urging customers to make purchases, often with offers/discounts to make the deals more appealing). Most of these emails could be categorized into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New items arrival</p></li>
<li><p>Member discounts</p></li>
<li><p>Holiday discounts</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If it’s not for me being a college student living on a student budget, which makes me an economic shopper, these offers are no more than ordinary marketing emails. They are not highly personalized to me as a customer nor trying to get my attention on other aspects of the products other than prices. Given that I do receive more promotional emails than the brand’s average sending behavior as demonstrated above, this could possibly be because they know I would not buy anything at full price, hence the influx of discounts and promotions. That being said, I do appreciate their efforts in testing different subject lines and times of day. This may involve A/B testing as a methodology to determine the better elements for a more effective marketing email campaign.</p>
</section>
<section id="mail-list-pii-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mail-list-pii-data">Mail list &amp; PII data</h2>
<p>I believe Adidas builds its own mail list by giving out member discounts for those who register using their emails. This process is fairly easy as the sign-up window would pop up for anyone visiting their official website. By having this process simple and quick, Adidas can attain high quality and niche PII (Personal Identifiable Information) from potential and recurring customers who are actually interested in the brand and purchasing its products.</p>

</section>
<section id="can-spam-laws-complied" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-spam-laws-complied">CAN-SPAM laws complied</h2>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003) is a law managed by the Federal Trade Commission to set the rules and regulations for sending commercial emails. I believe Adidas is following this law at its best from what I can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don’t use false/misleading headers.</li>
<li>They don’t use deceptive subject lines.</li>
<li>They identify the message as an advertisement</li>
<li>The opt-out option is clearly displayed at the bottom of each email</li>

<p>Data from <a href="https://brand24.com">BRAND24</a> shows that the brand is reaching millions of people and receiving mentions from hundreds if not thousands of people every day.

<section id="social-media-rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-media-rules">36 Social Media Rules</h2>
<p>In general, Adidas follows the 36 rules of social media pretty well as highlighted in a few below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>#17: Update your page or delete it.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For most of its social media handles, Adidas stays active with relevant content updated frequently to maintain its strong presence, except for Facebook, where the brand has not posted anything in the last few years. This seems reasonable given the majority of its audience, especially those in the U.S., has shifted their preference for other social media platforms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>#29: People don’t want to shop where they socialize.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Social media is a huge part of Adidas’s branding strategy that helps the brand stay relevant. As a result, the brand focuses its content on social aspects instead of CTAs for its products. Surfing through Adidas’ Instagram, I could see how the brand intends to build and maintain the positive sports energy that connects with its audience as a common ground and also as a value that the brand aims to deliver through its products.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>#14: Everyone’s an influencer.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adidas features athletes of diverse backgrounds and inspires everyone to become an athlete.I believe this is a crucial point in Adidas’ branding strategy as it enables customers to resonate with the brand’s spirit and personality.</li>
</ul></li>

<h1>Strong Presence of Reviews</h1>
<p>To assess the review presence of Adidas and its competitor - Nike, I looked at each brand’s website as well as Amazon, one of the largest third-party e-commerce site. Both Adidas and Nike have strong review presences on their e-commerce sites and Amazon, with average ratings generally between 4 and 5 stars. They share common themes in positive and negative reviews, with customers appreciating product quality, performance, and design, while expressing concerns about sizing and potential counterfeit items. Review volume for both brands is high on Amazon, indicating their popularity and social proof.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="website">Website</h2>
<p>Adidas has a strong presence of reviews on their e-commerce site, featuring reviews for most of their products, with average ratings ranging between 4 and 5 stars. Customer feedback often highlights product quality, comfort, and style as key factors driving satisfaction. Common issues mentioned in negative reviews include sizing inconsistencies and occasional product defects. Customers who have purchased products from their online store have the opportunity to leave a review, which can be seen by other online shoppers. This creates a transparent shopping experience and helps potential customers make informed decisions about their purchases.</p>

<p>Taking a closer look at this, analysis from AppBot shows that among the aforementioned number of reviews, there are 68,741 ones with text, making up an average rating of 3.9 stars. About two-thirds of these specific reviews rated 5 stars and imply positive sentiment toward the app. This is a pretty strong evidence that Adidas has been working well on building up and maintaining the connection with its customers in an effort to increase customer satisfaction and generate product reviews.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-not-as-good-as-nikes">…but not as good as Nike’s :(</h3>
<p>Nike also has their own app on Google Play Store with quite a stronger presence than that of Adidas. Nike’s app has an average rating of 4.5 stars from 694,836 - roughly the same as Adidas but with almost twice as many users as Adidas! Analysis from AppBot also shows a more positive reaction from the users: 225,955 reviews with text that make an average rating of 4.3 stars (compared to 68,741 text reviews of 3.9 stars on average for Adidas). So, Adidas might have done a great job, but Nike definitely has done a way better job.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="valuable-for-various-areas-of-improvement">Valuable for various areas of improvement</h3>
<p>Customer reviews oftentimes could provide valuable insights into product performance, customer preferences, and potential areas for improvement. By breaking down the average ratings by product category and subcategory, it would be possible to identify which products were resonating well with customers and which were underperforming. This analysis could help Adidas focus on improving lower-rated products or reevaluating its product assortment. Additionally, comparing Adidas’ average ratings with those of its competitors could provide a better understanding of the brand’s performance within the market. If Adidas’ average ratings were higher than its competitors’, this could indicate that the brand is successfully meeting or exceeding customer expectations. Conversely, if Adidas’ average ratings were lower than its competitors’, it might suggest that there are areas where the brand could improve to better compete in the market. Furthermore, analyzing the distribution of ratings and the review sentiment could reveal trends and patterns in customer feedback. A large number of negative reviews might indicate specific issues that need to be addressed, while a high proportion of positive reviews could highlight areas where the brand is excelling.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quite-consistent-with-what-is-being-said-on-social-media">Quite consistent with what is being said on social media</h3>
<p>To compare the consistency of what is being said about the brands on social media versus in the review, I conducted some social listening using <a href="https://brand24.com">BRAND24</a> to gauge an overview of the breakdown of the sentiment (positive vs.&nbsp;negative), as well as the overall dynamics of the two brands on social media. In general, the result is pretty consistent, with Nike still being a bit more popular with a consistently higher number of mentions over the last month.</p>
<p><img src="L.Tran_HW4_files/image/brand24_both.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>However, I was quite surprised that Adidas has a larger proportion of the mentions being positive compared to Nike. While 67.4% of Nike’s mentions are positive, that number is 83.4% for Adidas. This shows that Adidas might have a more effective social media strategy that focuses more on the quality of the interactions between the brand and its customers, or quality &gt; quantity.</p>

<h1>Final Recommendations</h1>
<p>Overall, I believe Adidas is doing quite well on many aspects regarding the brand’s efforts in branding, product development, as well as customer service and engagement given that for the most parts it is quite similar to Nike, a big competitor. Given all of the above analysis, I would recommend the following for Adidas as the next steps to further enhance its marketing strategy:</p>
<section id="start" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="start"><strong>Start</strong></h2>
<section id="personalized-email-content" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personalized-email-content">Personalized Email Content</h3>
<p>Personalization is a crucial aspect of email marketing as it allows brands to connect with customers on a more individualized level, providing them with content that resonates with their unique interests and needs. By leveraging customer data such as preferences, browsing behavior, and purchase history, Adidas can create tailored email campaigns that offer product recommendations, exclusive offers, and promotions that are more relevant to each customer. Adidas should start incorporating more personalized content in their email marketing strategy for higher open rates, click-through rates, and conversions.</p>
</section>
<section id="content-marketing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="content-marketing">Content Marketing</h3>
<p>Content marketing is a highly effective strategy for building brand awareness, establishing thought leadership, and driving organic traffic to a brand’s website. Adidas could start investing more in content marketing efforts, such as creating engaging and informative blog posts, videos, and other forms of content that resonate with their target audience. This can help establish Adidas as a thought leader in their industry, drive organic traffic to their website, improve search engine rankings, and build stronger relationships with their audience. It also provides an opportunity for the brand to showcase their values and personality beyond just their products, which can help to differentiate them from their competitors.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stop"><strong>Stop</strong></h2>
<section id="email-overload" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="email-overload">Email Overload</h3>
<p>While email marketing can be a powerful tool for reaching customers, it’s important for brands to strike a balance between promoting their products and overwhelming their customers with too many emails. If customers receive too many emails from a brand, they may start to tune them out or even unsubscribe from the email list, which can result in lower engagement rates and ultimately, lower sales.</p>
<p>To avoid email fatigue, Adidas should aim to reduce the frequency of their emails and ensure that each email provides real value to the customer. This could mean sending fewer emails per week or per month, with each email containing more valuable content such as product recommendations, exclusive offers, or new product releases. This approach can help to prevent customers from feeling bombarded with promotional emails and increase the likelihood that they will engage with the emails that they do receive.</p>
<p>A more optimal frequency for promotional emails may be around 3-4 per week at maximum, depending on the nature of the business and the audience being targeted. However, it’s important for Adidas to continually monitor email engagement rates and adjust their email frequency accordingly.</p>
</section>
<section id="sole-reliance-on-ctas" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sole-reliance-on-ctas">Sole Reliance on CTAs</h3>
<p>Adidas should stop relying solely on call-to-action (CTA) emails that focus solely on promotions and discounts. They should diversify their email content to include other types of content that provide value to customers, such as product features, customer stories, or brand news. By diversifying their email content beyond just promotions and discounts, Adidas can create a more well-rounded and holistic email marketing strategy that resonates with a wider range of customers. This can ultimately help to build stronger relationships with customers, increase engagement rates, and drive long-term success for the brand.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="continue"><strong>Continue</strong></h2>
<section id="brand-consistency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brand-consistency">Brand Consistency</h3>
<p>Adidas should continue maintaining a consistent brand image across all their marketing channels, including email, social media, and customer reviews. This includes using consistent messaging, visual elements, and brand voice to ensure a cohesive and recognizable brand identity. By maintaining a consistent brand image across all marketing channels, Adidas can create a strong brand identity that resonates with customers, build trust and credibility, increase brand loyalty, and ultimately drive long-term success for the brand.</p>
